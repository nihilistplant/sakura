# Basic usage

## Flowering cherry tree species
       
All cherry trees flower, even if only a few are noted and cultivated for their bloom, and even those not commonly celebrated as cherry blossoms have been planted and appreciated over the centuries for their elegant flowers and useful fruits, shoots, roots, and bark. These trees of <span eid="Q2946681">_Prunus subgenus Cerasus_</span> grow in temperate regions around the world and have moved in complex patterns across oceans and borders.

## Reverence + Use

The ancient Japanese were the first to watch sakura, which they saw as the seat of the mountain deity of rice paddies and a conduit for the souls of the dead to pass from this realm. Through this they came to understand the trees as markers of seasonal and spiritual cycles, looking to the timing of cherry blossom bloom as a bringer of spring as well as to forecast conditions for the autumn rice harvest and the length of winter, speaking to an understanding of flowering as both an environmental and mystical process.

This reverence and regard for sakura remained despite the physical, social, and geopolitical transformation of the land where they grew: hanami, or cherry blossom viewing, began as a ritual in honor of the sacred cycles of life and grew into the countless modern iterations of celebration seen around the world today, most often including the drinking of sake as well as singing, dancing, feasting, art-making, and showcasing of hybrid tree varieties. The rush of millions of hopeful viewers and festivalgoers chasing falling pink petals now figures heavily into springtime tourist economies across Japan as well as in cities from Washington, D.C. to Auckland, Hamburg to Busan.

Though less well-known than the East Asian ornamental species, <span eid="Q158987">black cherry</span> was [used by many American Indigenous nations](http://naeb.brit.org/uses/search/?string=prunus+serotina) for food, medicine, and woodworking, including the Cherokee, Potawatomi, and Shinnecock peoples. <span eid="Q165137">Sweet cherry</span> was used similarly by the ancient peoples of the Mediterranean region and Southeastern Europe, for food as well as for diuretic, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory medicine. Several species of 사쿠라나무 (sakuranamu, or flowering cherry trees) were also prominent in Korean folk medicine, used to treat a range of ailments including asthma, allergies, cough, heart failure, and viral disease. As such, cherry blossoms appeared in diet and medicine at places of tension or transformation among living things; they sustained life in the form of jam, wine, and preserve but also as disinfectant, vasorelaxant, diuretic, and detoxifier.


       
These indigenous uses of flowering cherries were typically matched with a spiritual component through which the trees served as an intermediary between life and death, seen in Cherokee teachings of the reciprocal relationship between humans and life-giving trees as well as in the funeral rites of early Mesolithic Europeans. Across three continents, cherry trees and their offerings to humans were treated with spiritual reverence, understood as markers of transformation in life at the level of cells and organs as well as in multispecies relationships, the ongoing shifts in the balance of forces that produce living bodies in interconnection. In the many societies where they appear, these trees have imparted healing and nourishment as well as wisdom about the turning of the universe.

## Naming

Sakura (さくら/ 桜) is just one of many names for flowering cherry trees, particularly those of Japan. 
                    

## Introduction + "Invasion"

Black cherry shifted in use over the course of American colonization, as forest management practices changed drastically and the traditional livelihoods of indigenous peoples were threatened. The species was one of the very first brought from North America to Europe, appearing in cultivation in Paris in 1623 and used as an ornamental until the late 18th and 19th centuries, when it became a target of interest for timber production. _P. serotina_ was widely planted for its ability to grow fast and well under a range of conditions, including on poor soils which the trees could improve with their nutritious and quickly-decomposing leaf litter. Though the species began to grow spontaneously as early as 1825, its fruits popular among seed-dispersing birds and mammals, it was not until the late 1900s that many began to note the spread of dense black cherry stands and characterize its “aggressive invasiveness,” which may well have been an effect of the original planting practice.

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]
